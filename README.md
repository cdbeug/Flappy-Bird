I followed the Youtube tutorial _Python Flappy Bird AI Tutorial (with NEAT) - Creating the Bird_, created by _Tech With Tim_
 ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2&ab_channel=TechWithTim ), to create a Flappy Bird game with Python and NEAT (a small neural network) in 2020.
